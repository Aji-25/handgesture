## ðŸ§  Overview
The **Gesture Volume Control** project lets you **change your computerâ€™s volume using hand gestures** detected through your webcam.  
It uses **computer vision** and **machine learning** techniques to recognize your hand and track its landmarks.  
By measuring the distance between specific hand landmarks (like the thumb and index finger), the system dynamically adjusts your computerâ€™s volume in real time.
